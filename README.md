This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

##### `pnpm build`

It correctly bundles NextJS in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
